## Everything About the Metaverse

‚óè The metaverse is a concept that refers to virtual worlds in which users, represented by avatars, interact. It is usually in 3D and focuses on social and economic connection \[1\].

‚óè The term metaverse originated from the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash, as a portmanteau of "meta" and "universe" \[1\]. In Snow Crash, the metaverse is a version of the internet that is a single, universal and immersive virtual world, facilitated by the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) headsets \[1, 2\].

‚óè The term is often linked to virtual reality technology and, in the early 2020s, Web3 \[1, 3, 4\]. It has been used as a buzzword by companies to exaggerate the development progress of various related technologies and projects for public relations purposes \[1, 5\].

‚óè There is no single agreed definition of the metaverse \[6\]. One description of it is the increasing permeability of the borders between different digital environments and the physical world, a space where you can interact with virtual objects in real life and with real-time information \[7\].

Elements of the Metaverse

The metaverse is a combination of three elements \[7\]:

‚óè Technology that enables digital content to be laid over the real world, similar to augmented reality (AR) \[7\].

‚óè A hardware device that enables the real world to be interactive \[7\].

‚óè Information about anything and everything in the physical world and knowledge about the user \[7\].

Accessing and Interacting with the Metaverse

‚óè Users typically need a device to connect to the metaverse. This device might be a pair of goggles, a head-mounted apparatus with a camera feature, or a new invention \[8\]. While such devices are not critical to engaging with the metaverse, they can amplify the experience \[8\].

‚óè Wearing a device connects the user to the metaverse by integrating all the elements and displaying the interactable virtual objects in real life \[8\].

Characteristics of the Metaverse

‚óè The metaverse will need to have several key attributes, including persistence, the ability to provide live, synchronous experiences, interoperability, and value creation, in order to reach its true potential \[9\].

‚óè It's unlikely to have a single entity building or operating it. Instead, many stakeholders will contribute to its existence, much like the real world \[9\].

Technologies and Concepts

The metaverse is a convergence of technologies, including:

‚óè Virtual Reality (VR): A technology that creates immersive, computer-generated environments that block out the physical world \[10\].

‚óè Augmented Reality (AR): A technology that overlays digital information onto the real-world environment to enhance real-world perception with digital elements \[10\].

‚óè Mixed Reality (MR): A technology that enables users to interact with digital and physical objects simultaneously by blending digital content into the real world \[10\].

‚óè Blockchain: A decentralized technology that allows for secure and transparent transactions \[10\].

‚óè Artificial Intelligence (AI): A technology that enables machines to learn and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence \[10\].

History and Evolution

‚óè The concept of the metaverse has its roots in science fiction literature and popular culture \[11-13\].
